# Native Android project files

All files in this directory are copied from `src/platforms/android` when building your plugin. You should make your changes to `AndroidManifest.xml` (manifest), `res` directory (resources), etc. in `src/platforms/android` and they will be automatically copied and packaged in an `.aar` file.
