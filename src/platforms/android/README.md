# Android permissions and dependencies

* (Optional) You can add resource files and edit the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located here. If you do not need custom permissions or resources, you can delete the `AndroidManifest.xml` file from this directory. NOTE: The NativeScript CLI will not resolve any contradicting or duplicate entries when including your native project to the mobile app. After the plugin is installed, you need to manually resolve such issues.

* (Optional) Use include.gradle configuration to describe any native dependencies. If there aren't any, this file can be removed. For more information, see the [include.gradle Specification](http://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugins#includegradle-specification)
