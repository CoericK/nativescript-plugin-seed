Options CLI to rebuild/not rebuild plugin's .aar file
- naming convention
- some flag we give to CLI saying do not rebuild .aar
- some cliignore-like file in platforms/android folder telling CLI not to build in .aar
- refer plugin in demo by .tgz and not symlink


scenarios

CLI 4.0
    - Android RT 4.0
        - expects .aar
        - plugin 3.x
            - CLI will remove flavors from include.gradle and will show warning 
            - CLI builds platforms/android folder into .aar and will show warning
            - [tns run android --syncAllFiles] CLI SHOULD re-build resources changes into .aar
        - plugin 4.x
            - [when symlinked] Plugin builds native-src folder into .aar
            - [when symlinked][tns run android --syncAllFiles] CLI MUST IGNORE resources changes and NOT build .aar
    - Android RT 3.0
        - does NOT expect .aar 
        - plugin 3.x    
            - [???] CLI will remove flavors from include.gradle and will show warning
            - Plugin does NOT build platforms/android folder into .aar
            - [???][tns run android --syncAllFiles] User needs to "tns platform remove android" when changing resources  
        - plugin 4.x    
            - Android RT adds flavors in include.gradle (to work as 3.x plugin)
            - [when symlinked][tns run android --syncAllFiles] CLI MUST IGNORE resources changes and NOT build .aar
            - [when symlinked] Plugin builds native-src folder into .aar


Workflow:

1. Clone seed
2. [src] Run postclone
3. [src] npm run build
4. [src] npm run plugin.tscwatch
5. [src] npm run plugin.resources.watch
6. [demo] npm run demo.android
7. ?


to discuss
- should we leave resource files in platforms/android in seed 4.0 ?

native watcher
- src/platforms/android
    - log warning to tell changes should not be done here
    - log warning move changed files to src-native
- src-native/android
    - log info building .aar
    - build .aar
